# games__tetris-ncurses
tetris made in c++ using ncurses.


## DISCLAIMER:
On Windows, considering the terminals on which I tested it, it works on WSL Ubuntu (from Microsoft store), but not on cmd and PowerShell (you can't see the colors).
## COMMANDS:
Simply, just like tetris (I guess):
- Left/Right Arrows: move left/right
- Up Arrow: change piece
- Down Arrow: speed up (while holded)
- R: after game over, when prompted, starts a new game
- Ctrl+C: exit the game (I know, it's missing something to exit the game properly)
